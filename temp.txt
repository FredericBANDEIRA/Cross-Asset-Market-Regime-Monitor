üö® HIGH PRIORITY - Core Requirements Missing
1. Market Regime Indicators
Implement regime classification logic (Growth, Inflation, Volatility regimes)

Add regime detection algorithms (statistical thresholds, clustering, etc.)

Create regime visualization (colored background periods, regime labels)

Add regime filter in sidebar

2. Term Structure Visualizations
Implement futures term structure charts for:

Equity futures (ES, NQ)

Gold futures (GC)

Crude Oil futures (CL)

Wheat futures (W)

Add term structure data sources and calculations

3. Yield Curves
Complete US Treasury yield curve visualization

Add German bond yield curve (Bund, Bobl, Schatz)

Implement yield curve comparison functionality

Add yield curve dynamics (flattening/steepening indicators)

üìä MEDIUM PRIORITY - Core Features Enhancement
4. Performance Metrics Completion
Add Inflation-linked bonds (TIPS) performance

Complete all asset classes from requirements:

Nominal bonds

Inflation-linked bonds

All commodities

Add performance comparison metrics (Sharpe, drawdowns, etc.)

5. Dashboard Layout & Structure
Organize into proper Streamlit sections:

Term structure section

Yield curve section

Heatmap comparison section

Implement proper sidebar filters for all categories

6. Filter Implementation
Complete time period filter functionality

Add asset class multi-select filter

Implement market regime filter

Add date range presets (1M, 3M, 1Y, YTD, etc.)

üîß TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS
7. Data Pipeline
